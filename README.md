# natural-scheme

Write your natural deduction proof trees using a scheme-like syntax, so that you can use a structural text editor for lisp-like languages
and make the job easier.

Later convert it to latex or to other formats.

Right now there are two latex backends:

- One using prftree, simpler to write for me.
- One using bussproofs, it is compatible with mathjax too, so html compatible!!


For example, in order to get this proof tree:
